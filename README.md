ASL Duolingo - American Sign Language Recognition
A project that leverages AI and computer vision to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures in real-time. This application uses MediaPipe for hand tracking and TensorFlow for ASL gesture recognition. The goal is to help users learn ASL in an interactive way similar to Duolingo.

Project Overview
This project includes:

Backend: A Flask server that serves the trained machine learning model for predicting ASL signs.
Frontend: A React-based frontend that interacts with the backend for real-time hand gesture recognition.
ASL Model: A pre-trained model (e.g., .h5) for recognizing ASL letters, trained using a dataset like Sign Language MNIST or a custom ASL dataset.
MediaPipe: Used for real-time hand tracking to extract keypoints from hands for gesture recognition.

Installation
Backend Setup (Flask)
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ASL-Duolingo.git
cd ASL-Duolingo
Set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy
Edit
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the Flask server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Frontend Setup (React)
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
Install React dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Your browser will open with the frontend application running.

Usage
Backend (Flask):

The backend provides an API endpoint to accept images from the frontend and predict the ASL letter.
Run app.py to start the Flask server and listen for incoming requests.
Frontend (React):

The frontend captures webcam feed and sends images to the backend to predict the ASL sign.
It displays the predicted sign on the screen in real-time.
Model:

The machine learning model takes hand images as input, processes them, and predicts the corresponding ASL letter.
Features
Real-Time ASL Recognition: Uses webcam feed to detect and recognize ASL signs instantly.
Hand Gesture Tracking: Powered by MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and tracking.
Model Predictions: Trained model predicts the ASL gesture from the webcam feed.
Interactive Learning: Users can learn ASL in a Duolingo-style app.
Multi-Hand Recognition: Supports detection of multiple hands and interprets signs based on the hands detected.
